      <description>A ferocious metaphysical dispute Some time ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I returned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a ferocious metaphysical dispute.
The focus of the dispute was a squirrel &amp;ndash; a live squirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the opposite side of the tree, a man was imagined to stand.
The man knows the squirrel is on the other side of the tree-trunk, but he can&amp;rsquo;t see the squirrel.</description>

Too many cooks  Two many cooks spoil the broth — except, when two heads are better than one.</description>
