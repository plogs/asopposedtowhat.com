      <title>Do billiard balls (or humans) have free will?</title>

      <description>Billiard balls If free will is &amp;ldquo;the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one&amp;rsquo;s own discretion,&amp;rdquo; then it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that billiard balls do not have free will.
Why? Because obviously when the cue ball strikes the eight ball, the eight ball doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide to bounce left or right. The eight ball doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide anything at all. Its movement is wholly constrained by physics.</description>

      <description>The short answer is No.
Gerbils are animals that have a sex, but not a gender.
Sex &amp;ldquo;Sex is a trait that determines an individual&amp;rsquo;s reproductive function, male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species through sexual reproduction. The type of gametes produced by an organism defines its sex. Commonly in plants and animals, male organisms produce smaller gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) while female organisms produce larger gametes (ova, often called egg cells).</description>

      <description>In these socially enlightend times it seems like everyone and his brother is coming out with a new identity. We&amp;rsquo;re rife with transformations. Who knew?
But why now? Have we always had men who are really women and women who are really men, and just not noticed? Apparently so. And woe to any bigot or non-woke individual who speaks out contrariwise.
Postmodernist thinking makes these transformations possible. Reality is apparently a fairy story.</description>

      <description>COVID-19: Hello and welcome everyone (and I do mean everyone). Covid here, along with Polio&amp;hellip;
POLIO: Hi, folks. I don&amp;rsquo;t get out much now, it&amp;rsquo;s a treat for me just to be here.
COVID-19: We&amp;rsquo;re here on behalf of viruses everywhere to say thanks. Thanks to anti-masker-vaxxers for making this pandemic (and my submicroscopic existence) such a success.
POLIO: Go&amp;hellip; team!
COVID-19: We recently reached our goal of 700,000 deaths&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>aka A ferocious metaphysical dispute Some time ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I returned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a ferocious metaphysical dispute.
The focus of the dispute was a squirrel &amp;ndash; a live squirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the opposite side of the tree, a man was imagined to stand.
The man knows the squirrel is on the other side of the tree-trunk, but he can&amp;rsquo;t see the squirrel.</description>

      <description>When You Assume  When you assume you make an ass out of you and me. [ASS U ME] — and yet, before it even makes sense to utter that statment, I assume you understand English; I assume that you can hear me, that you&amp;rsquo;re listening, that you&amp;rsquo;re not an asshat.  Too many cooks  Two many cooks spoil the broth — except, when two heads are better than one.</description>
