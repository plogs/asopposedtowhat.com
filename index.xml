      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s socially acceptable to come out &amp;lsquo;trans&amp;rsquo; nowadays, so here goes, I&amp;rsquo;m coming out.
But first I want to say that I&amp;rsquo;m not proud of the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve waited this long to come out, but I&amp;rsquo;m also not embarrassed &amp;ndash; at least not any longer. If postmodernism has taught us anything, it&amp;rsquo;s taught us that we can be whoever we say we are and fuck-you bigots if you disagree.</description>

      <description>COVID-19: Hello and welcome everyone (and I do mean everyone). Covid here, along with Polio&amp;hellip;
POLIO: Hi, folks. I don&amp;rsquo;t get out much now, it&amp;rsquo;s a treat for me just to be here.
COVID-19: We&amp;rsquo;re here on behalf of viruses everywhere to say thanks. Thanks to anti-masker-vaxxers for making this pandemic (and my submicroscopic existence) such a success.
POLIO: Go&amp;hellip; team!
COVID-19: We recently reached our goal of 700,000 deaths&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>aka A ferocious metaphysical dispute1 Some time ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I returned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a ferocious metaphysical dispute.
The focus of the dispute was a squirrel &amp;ndash; a live squirrel supposed to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the opposite side of the tree, a man was imagined to stand.
The man knows the squirrel is on the other side of the tree-trunk, but he can&amp;rsquo;t see the squirrel.</description>

      <description>When You Assume  When you assume you make an ass out of you and me. [ASS U ME] — and yet, before it even makes sense to utter that statment, I assume you understand English; I assume that you can hear me, that you&amp;rsquo;re listening, that you&amp;rsquo;re not an asshat.  Too many cooks  Two many cooks spoil the broth — except, when two heads are better than one.</description>
