  <section><p>Being asked, for example, to respect gay marriage (even if it&rsquo;s
against my religious beliefs) or to be kind and pay for curb cuts for
the handicapped, doesn&rsquo;t require me to change my behaviour (except
for paying taxes for something I might disagree with). But
&lsquo;respecting&rsquo; someone else&rsquo;s personal pronouns does require me to act
differently.</p>
<p>It changes the way I speak; it changes the words that I use. And not
because I decided to speak differently (I think I speak just fine
already, thank you very much), but because someone else&rsquo;s ideology
tells me to speak differently, regardless of what I may think about
that ideology. Indeed I&rsquo;m compelled to speak differently if I wish to
avoid being ostracized.</p>
<p>So, for anyone demanding this type of &lsquo;respect&rsquo;, here are some words
that align with <em>my</em> worldview, and I say this with all due respect:
go fuck yourself.</p>
