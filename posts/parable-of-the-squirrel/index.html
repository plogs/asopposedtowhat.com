<h2 id="a-ferocious-metaphysical-dispute">A ferocious metaphysical dispute</h2>
<p>Some time ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I
returned from a solitary ramble to find everyone engaged in a
ferocious metaphysical dispute.</p>
<p>The focus of the dispute was a <em>squirrel</em> &ndash; a live squirrel supposed
to be clinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the
opposite side of the tree, a man was imagined to stand.</p>
<p>The man knows the squirrel is on the other side of the tree-trunk,
but he can&rsquo;t see the squirrel.</p>
<p>So the man tries to catch sight of the squirrel by running around the
tree, but no matter how fast he moves, the squirrel moves just as
fast, but in the opposite direction. So the squirrel always keeps the
tree between himself and the man. The man never sees the squirrel.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-man-go-around-the-squirrel">Does the man go around the squirrel?</h2>
<p>The resultant metaphysical dispute was this: Does the man go around
the squirrel?</p>
<p>He goes around the <em>tree</em>, sure enough, and the squirrel is <em>on</em> the
tree; but does the man go around the squirrel?</p>
<p>In the unlimited leisure of the wilderness, and after draining a few
bottles of wine, the discussion had grown contentious. Which is to
say, everyone had taken sides.</p>
<h2 id="the-controversy">The controversy</h2>
<p>Half said <em>yes</em> the man goes around the squirrel. Half said, no, he
doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yes, he does.</p>
<p><em>No</em>, he doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>They appealed to me to make it a majority, one way or the other.
Mindful of the scholastic adage that when you meet a contradiction,
it&rsquo;s often helpful to make a distinction, I did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that it comes down to what you <em>practically mean</em>
by &lsquo;going around&rsquo; the squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="what-you-mean">What you mean</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean passing first from the north of him to the east, then to
the south, then to the west, and then to the north of him again,
obviously the man <em>does</em> go around the squirrel, because the man
occupies those positions. He does exactly that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if, on the other hand, you mean by &lsquo;going around&rsquo; being first in
<em>front</em> of the squirrel, then on the right of the squirrel, then
<em>behind</em> the squirrel, then to his left, and finally in front again,
it&rsquo;s obvious the man fails to go around the squirrel, because the
squirrel keeps his belly turned towards the man the whole time. The
man never gets <em>behind</em> the squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="so-it-depends">So it depends</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Make the distinction,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and the argument is over. You are
both right and both wrong depending on what you mean practically by
the phrase &lsquo;goes around&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the most part everyone agreed: the answer depends upon what you
mean when you say, &ldquo;<em>Goes around</em>.&rdquo;</p>
