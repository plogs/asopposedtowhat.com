		<h1 align='center'>On coming out TransGentry</h1>
<div class="post-line"></div>


		

		<p>In these socially enlightened times it seems everyone and his brother
is coming out with a new identity. We&rsquo;re rife with transformations.
Who knew?</p>
<p>But why now? Have we always had men who are really women and women
who are really men, and just not noticed? Apparently so. And woe to
any bigot or non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke">woke</a>
individual who speaks out contrariwise.</p>
<p>Most people agree that adults have the right to transform themselves
in a way that makes their life better. Why not? Why do we care? More
power to them.</p>
<p>But sadly, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism">postmodernist</a> thinking
that&rsquo;s often dragged out to justify the new world order is seen by
many to have gone too far.</p>
<p>Reality, it seems, is not real.
The idea that there is an objective reality independent of human beings
is dismissed by postmodernists as a kind of naive realism.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
So what <em>is</em> real? Well, nothing, except
whatever you feel is real; you know, your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience">lived
experience</a>.
It&rsquo;s all socially constructed.</p>
<p>So I, too, threw my hat into the transformation ring.</p>
<p>All my life I&rsquo;ve felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special. When I look in the mirror, I see a worker, a
common man; but that&rsquo;s not all. Deep down inside I also see a king. A
king born in a worker&rsquo;s body? Apparently so. I&rsquo;ve felt this way all
my life.</p>
<p><img src="/images/King_of_Persis_Ardashir_II_with_crown_1st_century_BCE.jpg" alt="king with crown"></p>
<p>My &lsquo;lived experience&rsquo; reveals to me just how king-like I am. For
example, I truly enjoy it when people (of any class) wait on me and
bring me things. They might not appreciate the gaping disparity in
our respective social classes, but I do, and I wish them well.</p>
<h2 id="gentry-dysphoria">Gentry dysphoria</h2>
<p>Why mention my <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry">gentry</a>
dysphoria</em> now, after years of living like a peasant and making do?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: pronouns.</p>
<p>In these socially malleable times one may now demand that a pronoun
serves at the pleasure of a given participant. In truth, failure to
do so may even be considered <em>oppressive</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h2>
<p>A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, <em>she</em> said this, or <em>he</em> said that, or <em>they</em> are coming
over for dinner.</p>
<p>Pronouns used to be self-evident. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>he</li>
<li>she</li>
<li>him</li>
<li>her</li>
<li>himself</li>
<li>herself</li>
<li>they</li>
<li>them</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have &lsquo;gender neutral&rsquo; and &lsquo;gender inclusive&rsquo; pronouns, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>ve</li>
<li>ze</li>
<li>xem</li>
<li>xyr</li>
<li>perself</li>
<li>verself</li>
<li>humself</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are many more (<a href="https://bobcutmag.com/2021/09/07/what-are-the-78-gender-pronouns/">What are the 78 Gender
pronouns?</a>).
Language, as you know, evolves.</p>
<p>Demands to use certain words by the language police (or by anyone
else for that matter) are of course bad form, and extremely annoying.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, people sometimes cloyingly insist on the use of their
new and improved personal pronouns. When that happens, I roll out my
new and improved personal pronouns.</p>
<h2 id="my-preferred-gentry-pronouns-pgp">My preferred gentry pronouns (PGP)</h2>
<p>Whilst in my presence you may call me <em>YourHighness</em> or <em>YourMajesty</em>.</p>
<p>For example, <em>HisHighness</em> said this, or
<em>my liege</em> said that, or <em>HisMajesty</em> is coming over for dinner.</p>
<p>At all other times, <em>YourHighness</em> will do.</p>
<p>We have spoken.</p>

<p>Failing to respect someone else&rsquo;s identity preferences &ldquo;is not
only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive,&rdquo; says The University of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Indeed, &ldquo;When someone is referred to with the
wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated,
dismissed, alienated, or [gentry] dysphoric.&rdquo;
