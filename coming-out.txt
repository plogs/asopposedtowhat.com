                        Coming Out TransGentry

It's socially acceptable to come out trans' nowadays, so here goes,
I'm coming out.

But first I want to say that I'm not proud of the fact that I've
waited this long to come out, but I'm also not embarrassed -- at
least not any longer. If postmodernism has taught us anything, it's
taught us that we can be whoever we say we are and fuck-you bigots if
you disagree.

What am I coming out as?

All my life I've felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special.

When I look in the mirror, I see a worker's body, but deep down
inside I know that I'm a king. Yes, a king born in a worker's body.

My lived experience' reveals to me just how king-like I am. For
example, I truly enjoy it when people (of any class) wait on me and
bring me things. They might not appreciate the gaping disparity in
our respective social classes, but I do, and I wish them well.

Why mention my gentry dysphoria now?

The answer is simple: bully pronouns.

Not only has it become socially acceptable to come out as 'trans',
but now it's also acceptable to dictate to others what words to use,
and when. This seems like bully behavior to me, but rather than
resist it, I choose to embrace it.

A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, _she_ said this, or _he_ said that, or _they_ are coming
over for dinner.

In the good old days a handful of pronouns sufficed. It used to be:

    • he 
    • she 
    • him 
    • her 
    • himself 
    • herself 
    • they 
    • them 

But now we have ‘gender neutral’ and ‘gender inclusive’ pronouns. So it’s:

    • ve 
    • ze 
    • xem 
    • xyr 
    • perself 
    • verself 
    • xyrs 
    • xem 

and so on. And when I say 'and so on' I mean there are many more (78
gender pronouns?). Language, as you know, evolves.

I did not, however, have to invent a new pronoun to match my new
identity. The existing usage will suffice.

You may call me _YourHighness_ or _YourMajesty_ when you are in my
presence. For example, _HisHighness_ said this, or _YourMajesty_ said
that.

At all other times, _YourHighness_ will do.[1]

    1. Failing to respect someone else's identity preferences is not
    only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive. So thanks in
    advance for not using pronouns that make me feel disrespected,
    invalidated, dismissed, alienated, or gentry dysphoric.
