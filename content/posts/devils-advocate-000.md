* Say something...

## Inspirations

* David Goggins - [Don't Be Little B*tch, STAY HARD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXSF0SiBec)
  When you leave the house, society will kick you in your _fucking ass_.
  Life will fuck you up if you're not fucking ready. Sorry.

* David Goggins - [Sounds like a straight bitch when I listen to that
  [tape of myself]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnP123BM5FI)

* Richard Feynman. [Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)
  When you explain a 'why' you have to be in some framework that you allow
  something to be true. Otherwise you're perpetually asking why.

* David Goggins - Stop Bitching
  [What the fuck are you doing about it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz5sBHOi3CQ)

* David Goggins | Stop Caring What Other People Think Of You
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrSLOHt3urY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrSLOHt3urY)



* Gary Vee
  [Stop watching fucking lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ0Uaag5s60)


## joke ideas

* I like the deadpan look  when he's caught -
  [Playing THE FORBIDDEN RIFF in a Huge Guitar Store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2Z-5Bop7-g)


> head turn, eyebrow lift [deadpan]
>
> [voice over] as opposed to what...

"As opposed to what? ...

"Do you mean..."

 * there's more than one way to look at this?

 * there's not only _one_ way to look at this?

 * there's another way to look a this?

 * I might be wrong?

 * there's another answer?

 * there's another approach?

 * there's another solution?

 * that doesn't make sense?

 * I should think about this again?

 * I should take another look?

 * there's another way to view the world?

 * there's an alternate explanation?

 * there's a better way to look at this?

 * there's a more charitable way to look at this?

 * there's a simpler view?

 * that other normal people, like me, see things differently?

 * there's another way to look at this?

## misc. notes

A prescription for those of us with
[inattentional blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness).

The feeling that: There's very damn few us of, but you are not alone.
