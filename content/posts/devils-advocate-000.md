## Inspirations

* David Goggins - [Don't Be Little B*tch, STAY HARD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELXSF0SiBec)
  When you leave the house, society will kick you in your _fucking ass_.
  Life will fuck you up if you're not fucking ready. Sorry.

* David Goggins - [Sounds like a straight bitch when I listen to that [tape of myself]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnP123BM5FI)

* Richard Feynman. [Why.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA)
  When you explain a 'why' you have to be in some framework that you allow
  something to be true. Otherwise you're perpetually asking why.

* David Goggins - Stop Bitching [What the fuck are you doing about it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz5sBHOi3CQ)
