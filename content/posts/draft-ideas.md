# education ideas

* "Everything is what it is, and not something else." It's not
  turtles all the way down. Where to start.[^1]

    1. The Law of Identity: A is A.
    2. The Law of Non-contradiction: Nothing can be both A and not-A.
    3. The Law of Excluded Middle: Everything is either A or not-A.

# 'church' ideas

* If there's no god, where does morality come from?

* What happens when we die? Do we die dead?


# video notes

 * Don't have long graphics/musical intros.

 * Do not say, "Let's get started."

 * Do not say, "Remember to subscribe and click the bell button..."



# personal pronouns

"Preferred" personal pronouns?

No, You get to choose your name, not your pronouns. Why? Because I
"identity as" (and actually am) a person whose "lived experience"
says that one should be the master of their own thoughts and speach;
therefore insisting, either implicitly or explicitly, that I use
someone else's words is not only an egotistically rude request to me
as a person worthy of respect, but also dangerously "harmful" to my
well-being as a legitimate person (because it offends me deeply and
makes me feel bad inside).
