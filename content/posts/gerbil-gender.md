The short answer is: No.
[Gerbils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_gerbil) are animals
that have a [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex), but not a
gender.

## Sex

"Sex is a trait that determines an individual's reproductive function,
male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species
through sexual reproduction. The type of
[gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete) produced by an
organism defines its sex. Commonly in plants and animals, male
organisms produce smaller gametes (sperm) while female
organisms produce larger gametes (ova, or egg cells)."[^1]

## Gametes

Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called
[hermaphrodites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite).
"Hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual
reproduction in which either partner can act as the female or male."

"There have been no identified cases of a human reproducing as both
male and female."[^2]

Earthworms and slugs are examples of hermaphrodites.

## Gender

What is gender?

Originally _gender_ was a word that refered to grammatical
categories. For example, in the French language, table [une table] is
feminine (or female) gender, and book [un livre] is masculine (or
male) gender.

Today, however, [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) is a
fluid term that refers to a range of characteristics pertaining to
human femininity and masculinity, and differentiating between the
two. See, for example, [68 Terms That Describe Gender Identity and Expression](https://www.healthline.com/health/different-genders).


"Sex is a biological concept; gender is a human social and cultural
concept."[^3]

Gerbil's do not have a gender. Their sex is male or female.

## What about the sex spectrum?

As described above, there are two sexes observable in the animal
world. Males are the sex that have the reproductive anatomy designed
to produce small gametes (or sperm), and females are the sex that
have the reproductive anatomy designed to produce large gametes (or
ova). This is true not just for humans, but for all mammals.

There are, of course, intersex people who are born with ambiguous sex
characteristics. But this does not imply a spectrum[^4].

A nickel has two sides: a head side and a tail side. But sometimes
when you flip a nickel onto the table it will land on its edge. This
happens roughly 1 out of every 6,000 flips of the coin. When that
occurs we don't then conclude that the two sides of the coin are
somehow on a spectrum. We just know that every now and then the
outcome of the flip is ambiguous.[^5]

We do keep track of three nominal sides -- heads, tails, and on edge
-- when performing coin toss experiments. But there is no third sex
(let alone a sex spectrum) observable in the animal world.
