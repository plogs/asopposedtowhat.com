The short answer is No.

Gerbils are animals that have a
[sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex), but not a gender.


## Sex

"Sex is a trait that determines an individual's reproductive function,
male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species
through sexual reproduction. The type of
[gametes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete) produced by an
organism defines its sex. Commonly in plants and animals, male
organisms produce smaller gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) while female
organisms produce larger gametes (ova, often called egg cells)."[^1]

## Gametes

Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called
[hermaphrodites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite).
Earthworms and slugs are examples of hermaphrodites.


## Gender

What is gender?

Originally _gender_ was a word that refered to grammatical
categories. For example, in the French language, table [une table] is
feminine (or female) gender, and book [un livre] is masculine (or
male) gender.

Today, however, [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) is a
fluid term that refers to a range of characteristics pertaining to
human femininity and masculinity, and differentiating between the
two. See, for example, [68 Terms That Describe Gender Identity and Expression](https://www.healthline.com/health/different-genders).


"Sex is a biological concept; gender is a human social and cultural
concept."[^2]

Gerbil's do not have a gender. Their sex is male or female.
