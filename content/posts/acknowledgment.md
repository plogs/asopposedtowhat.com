At the beginning of many events
it's now fashionable to begin with
an _indigenous land acknowledgment_, usually something along these
lines:

<div style='margin-left: .5em; margin-right: .5em; padding: 1em; background-color: #ffcc99; font-family: monospace;'>
"We would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in
[insert PLACE NAME], the ancestral and unceded territory of the
[so-and-so] people."
</div>

The ostensible goal of these acknowledgments is to promote a "greater
public consciousness of Native sovereignty and cultural
rights." [^neefusa]

But strangely, these acknowledgments always seem a bit short-sighted,
given that they only acknowledge the previous land occupants. Not the
ones before them, or the ones before them, and so on, all the way
back to the [Clovis
People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture), the first
settlers of North America.[^emerged]

Clovis refers to the earliest [^debated] known prehistoric
Native American culture. One theory is that the
Clovis people crossed the [Bering Land
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) from Siberia and
moved south through an ice-free corridor into the central U.S.,
approximately 12,800 years ago. (See also [Peopling of the
Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas).)

Clovis culture pre-dates our modern-day concept of land ownership, so
Clovis land could never have been legally ceded or given freely.

Today, the 574 federally recognized [^recognized] tribes (Cherokee,
Choctaw, Sioux, Comanche, Chnook, Inuit, etc.) occupy land that was
once the home of the Clovis people. This land, in turn, was
subsequently appropriated by Spanish explorers, English settlers, and
other European colonists.

Given what we know of human nature in general, and Native American
populations in particular, it's likely that
'land appropriation' throughout history (from the Clovis culture
thousands of years ago to modern tribes today -- even prior to
European colonization, circa 1492), was likely violent and
unforgiving.

 * Violence between Native American tribes took many forms. [^violence]

 * War captives were executed in ritual ways, sometimes involving
   torture, as a form of spiritual justice or communal healing. [^war]

 * Indigenous slavery existed in some regions even before European
   contact. [^slavery]

 * Scalping occurred both before and after European contact, though
   colonial powers (like the British and French) later encouraged it
   with bounties.[^scalping] [^scalp1] [^scalp2] [^scalp3] [^scalp4]

 * Raiding was sometimes a way of life, targeting rival tribes or
   agricultural villages. [^raiding]


Not all Native American history was violence, of course. Many
tribes maintained long-standing peace with neighbors and used
diplomacy, intermarriage, and trade to manage relations. [^peace]

And yet the question remains: How far back does one go when
acknowledging "public consciousness of Native sovereignty and
cultural rights"?

Today's Native American tribes haven't always been here. Undoubtedly
the current tribes (and/or their descendants) displaced previous
tribes, even before European colonists came on the scene.
[^displaced] [^warfare]

So one wonders. Did
Native American tribes do land acknowledgments, too?
Probably not.

Then why do we do it?

# Virtue signaling

Land acknowledgments are a form of [virtue
signaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling).
No one really cares about the public consciousness of Native
sovereignty and cultural rights. What we care about -- some of us, anyway --
are the good feelings that we get when we imply
that _our_ invading culture has learned from the past and is now
somehow better than the previous invading cultures.[^better]

How do we imply this?

We imply this by conspicuously drawing attention to our occupation of
unceded land that was unceremoniously appropriated from indigenous
tribes who themselves managed to occupy unceded land from prior
indigenous tribes, who in turn managed to occupy ancestral unceded
territory from prior previous tribes, and so on and so forth, all the
way back to the Clovis people who's distant ancestors originally came
from Africa. [^c1] [^c2]

So the final thing to say about land acknowledgments really is just
this. Are we going to give the land back?

No.

Then shut up about it.
