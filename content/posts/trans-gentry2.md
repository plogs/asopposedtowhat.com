In these socially enlightend times it seems like
everyone and his brother is coming out with a new identity. We're
rife with transformations.  Who knew?

But why now? Have we always had men who are really women and women
who are really men, and just not noticed? Apparently so.
And woe to any bigot or
non-[woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke) individual who speaks
out contrariwise.

[Postmodernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) thinking
makes these transformations possible. Reality is apparently a fairy
story. What's real? Well nothing is _real_. It's your vibe, man,
whatever you feel, your [lived
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience). If it
feels right for you, then it's real -- for you.

So I, too, threw my hat into the transformation ring, and I was
surprised by what came out. Here's what came out.


All my life I've felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special. When I look in the mirror, I see a worker, a
comman man; but that's not all. Deep down inside I also see a king.
Yes, a king born in a worker's body. I've felt this way all my life.

My 'lived experience' reveals to me just how king-like I am. For
example, I truly enjoy it when people (of any class) wait on me and
bring me things. They might not appreciate the gaping disparity in
our respective social classes, but I do, and I wish them well.

## Gentry dysphoria

Why mention my _[gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry) dysphoria_ now?

The answer is simple: pronouns.

In addition to deciding what is and what is not real, we also
in these socially enlightened times get to pick our pronouns.


## Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, _she_ said this, or _he_ said that, or _they_ are coming
over for dinner.

Pronouns used to be self-evident:

- he
- she
- him
- her
- himself
- herself
- they
- them

Now we have 'gender neutral' and 'gender inclusive' pronouns:

- ve
- ze
- xem
- xyr
- perself
- verself
- xyrs
- xem

And there are many more ([78 gender
pronouns?](https://bobcutmag.com/2021/09/07/what-are-the-78-gender-pronouns/)).
Language, as you know, evolves.

## My preferred gentry pronouns (PGP)

Here, then, are my preferred gentry pronouns.

You may call me _YourHighness_ or _YourMajesty_ when you are in my
presence. For example, _HisHighness_ said this, or _YourMajesty_ said that.

At all other times, _YourHighness_ will do.[^1]


[^1]: Failing to respect someone else's identity preferences "is not
only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive," says The University of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Indeed, "When someone is referred to with the
wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated,
dismissed, alienated, or [gentry] dysphoric."
