## From 2010 to 2020, gender gap in Seattle tech stayed largely the same[^1]

I picked up the morning paper recently and saw the headline about the
gender gap in Seattle remaining mostly the same. It took me a minute
to realize they were talking about the gender gap, and not the gender
_pay_ gap.

The gender pay gap seems to always be in the news. You know, showing
how much less women earn than men?

93 cents on the dollar

Most small business fail within the first year. If it's really true
that women are paid less, then here's a pro time for small business
owners. Hire only women and pay them less. Or I mean, hire only women
and [begin air quotes] pay them [end air quotes]. You'll save money
(obviously), and may even keep your business alive.

But it wasn't the gender pay gap, it was the gender gap. The gender gap...?

## As opposed to what?

What do you mean by the gender gap? Do you mean the difference between
men and women? There's a _gap_?
