Back in the day, Sneed liked to carry a pumpkin. He never really
explained why, but I guess his weirdness wore off on me because I
developed an equally bizarre hankering for zucchinis.

I remember once we walked into a Denny's restaurant and the waitress
asked if I was happy to see her or if that was a cucumber in my
pocket. No, it a zucchini, I said. Sneed nearly dropped his pumpkin.

The waitress was not amused.
