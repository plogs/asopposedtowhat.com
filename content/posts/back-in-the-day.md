Back in the day, Sneed liked to carry a pumpkin around with him
wherever he went. He never really explained why. But I guess his
weirdness wore off on me, because for some inexplicable reason I
developed a hankering for zucchinis.

I still remember the time we walked into a Denny's restaurant and the
waitress asked if I was happy to see her or if that was a cucumber in
my pocket. No, I said, it's my zucchini. Sneed laughed and almost
dropped his pumpkin. The waitress was not amused.
