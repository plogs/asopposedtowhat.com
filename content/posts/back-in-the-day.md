Back in the day, Sneed liked to carry a pumpkin. He never really
explained why, but I guess his weirdness wore off on me because I
developed an equally bizarre hankering for zucchinis.

Once we walked into a Denny's restaurant and the waitress asked if I
had a cucumber in my pocket.

"No," I said, "it's a zucchini. Are you happy to see me?"
