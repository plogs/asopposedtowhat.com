I identify as an old-school-pronoun person.

My concept of self is tied to the use of traditonal pronouns (i.e.,
he, she, them, they). I can't explain why; that's just who I am.

Even the concept of so-called preferred pronouns feels
dististurbingly wrong. A significant amount of distress wells up
inside. It's a tremendous source of anxiety. I guess you could say I
have pronoun dysphoria.

So plese don't ask me to inflict harm on myself by insisting or even
implying that I should act in a way counter to my innermost sense of
self.
