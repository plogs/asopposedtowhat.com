It's socially acceptable to come out '[trans](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trans)' nowadays, so here goes,
I'm coming out.

But first I want to say that I'm not proud of the fact that I've
waited this long to come out, but I'm also not embarrassed -- at
least not any longer. If
[postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) has
taught us anything, it's taught us that we can be whoever we say we
are and fuck-you bigots if you disagree.

What am I coming out as?

All my life I've felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special.

When I look in the mirror, I see a worker's body, but deep down inside
I know that I'm a king. Yes, a king born in a worker's body.

My [lived experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience)
reveals to me just how king-like I am. For example, I truly enjoy it
when people (of any class) wait on me and bring me things. They might
not appreciate the gaping disparity in our respective social
classes, but I do, and I wish them well.

## My Gentry dysphoria

Why mention my _[gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry) dysphoria_ now?

The answer is simple: bully pronouns.

Not only has it become socially acceptable to come out as 'trans',
but now it's also acceptable to dictate to others what words to use,
and when. This seems like bully behavior to me, but rather than
resist it, I choose to embrace it.


## Bully pronouns

A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, _she_ said this, or _he_ said that, or _they_ are coming
over for dinner.

Pronouns used to be self-evident:

- he
- she
- him
- her
- himself
- herself
- they
- them

But now we have 'gender neutral' and 'gender inclusive' pronouns. So
it's:

- ve
- ze
- xem
- xyr
- perself
- verself
- xyrs
- xem

and so on. And when I say _and so on_ I mean there are many more ([78
gender
pronouns?](https://bobcutmag.com/2021/09/07/what-are-the-78-gender-pronouns/)).
Language, as you know, evolves.

I did not, however, have to invent new pronouns to match my new
identity. Adequate pronouns were already available.

## My preferred gentry pronouns (PGP)

Here, then, are my preferred gentry pronouns.

You may call me _YourHighness_ or _YourMajesty_ when you are in my
presence. For example, _HisHighness_ said this, or _YourMajesty_ said that.

At all other times, _YourHighness_ will do.[^1]


[^1]: Failing to respect someone else's identity preferences is not
only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive. So thanks in
advance for not using pronouns that make me feel disrespected,
invalidated, dismissed, alienated, or gentry dysphoric.
