In these socially enlightened times it seems everyone and his brother
is coming out with a new identity. We're rife with transformations.
Who knew?

But why now? Have we always had men who are really women and women
who are really men, and just not noticed? Apparently so. And woe to
any bigot or non-[woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke)
individual who speaks out contrariwise.

Most people agree that adults have the right to transform themselves
in a way that makes their life better. And why not? More
power to them.

But sadly, the
[postmodernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) thinking
that's often whipped out to justify the new world order is seen by
many to have gone too far. How far?

Reality, it seems -- as we used to know it in the pre-woke days -- is not
real. The idea that there's an objective reality independent of human
beings is dismissed by postmodernists as a kind of naive realism.[^1]
Naive as in "showing a lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment."

So what _is_ real? Well... nothing; except whatever you feel is real.
You know, your [lived
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience). It's not
about the facts, man, it's about you understanding the meaning of your
experiences. It's all socially constructed.

Okay. So I, too, threw my hat into the
transformation ring.

All my life I've felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special. When I look in the mirror, I see a worker, a
common man. But deep down inside I know there's more to me than
what's shown in the mirror. Deep down inside of me I see a king. Yes,
I'm a king born in a worker's body. I've felt this way all my life.

And indeed my 'lived experience' tells me it must be so. For
example, I truly enjoy it when people (of any class) wait on me and
bring me things. They might not appreciate the gaping disparity in
our respective social classes, but I do, and I wish them well.

## Gentry dysphoria

But I don't need to flaunt my greatness. I am what I am regardless of
what society thinks about me. So why mention my
_[gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry) dysphoria_ now, after
years of living like a peasant and making do?

The answer is simple: pronouns.

In these socially malleable times one may now demand that a pronoun
serves at the pleasure of a given participant. In truth, failure to
do so may even be considered _oppressive_.[^2]

## Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, _she_ said this, or _he_ said that, or _they_ are coming
over for dinner.


Pronouns used to be self-evident. For example:

- he
- she
- him
- her
- himself
- herself
- they
- them

Now we have 'gender neutral' and 'gender inclusive' pronouns, such as:

- ve
- ze
- xem
- xyr
- perself
- verself
- humself

And there are many more ([What are the 78 Gender
pronouns?](https://bobcutmag.com/2021/09/07/what-are-the-78-gender-pronouns/)).
Language, as you know, evolves.

However, demands to use certain words by the language police (or by
anyone else for that matter) are of course bad form and extremely
annoying.

Nevertheless, people sometimes cloyingly insist on the use of their
new and improved personal pronouns. Here are mine.


## My preferred gentry pronouns (PGP)


Whilst in my presence you may call me _YourHighness_ or _YourMajesty_.

For example, _HisHighness_ said this, or
_my liege_ said that, or _HisMajesty_ is coming over for dinner.

At all other times, _YourHighness_ will do.

We have spoken.

[^2]: Failing to respect someone else's identity preferences "is not
only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive," says The University of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Indeed, "When someone is referred to with the
wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated,
dismissed, alienated, or [gentry] dysphoric."
