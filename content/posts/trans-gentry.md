It's socially acceptable to come out '[trans](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trans)' nowadays, so here goes,
I'm coming out.

But first I want to say that I'm not proud of the fact that I've
waited this long to come out, but I'm also not embarrassed -- at
least not any longer. If
[postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) has
taught us anything, it's taught us that we can be whoever we say we
are and fuck-you bigots if you disagree.

What am I coming out as?

All my life I've felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special.

When I look in the mirror, I see a worker's body, but deep down inside
I know that I'm a king. Yes, a king born in a worker's body.

My [lived experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience)
reveals to me just how king-like I am. For example, I truly enjoy it
when people (of any class) wait on me and bring me things. They might
not appreciate the gaping disparity in our respective social
classes, but I do, and I wish them well.

## My Gentry dysphoria

Why mention my _[gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry) dysphoria_ now?

The answer is simple: pronouns.

Not only has it become socially acceptable to come out as 'trans', but now
it's also common to tell others what words to use, and when.

A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, _she_ said this, or _he_ said that, or _they_ are coming
over for dinner.

In the good old days a handful of pronouns sufficed. Today we have
'gender neutral' and 'gender inclusive' pronouns.

It used to
be:

- he
- she
- him
- her
- himself
- herself
- they
- them

Now it's:

- ve
- ze
- xem
- xyr
- perself
- verself
- xyrs
- xem


and so on. And when I say 'and so on' I mean there are many ([78
gender pronouns?](https://bobcutmag.com/2021/09/07/what-are-the-78-gender-pronouns/)).
Language, as you know, evolves.

But I did not invent a new pronoun for my new identity. I didn't have
to. The existing usage will suffice.

## Preferred gentry pronouns (PGP)

You may call me _YourHighness_ or _YourMajesty_ when you are in my
presence. For example, _HisHighness_ said this, or _YourMajesty_ said that.

At all other times, _YourHighness_ will do.[^1]


[^1]: Failing to respect someone else's identity
preferences is not only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive.
 _Thanks in advance_ for not using pronouns that make me
feel disrespected, invalidated, dismissed, alienated, or dysphoric.
