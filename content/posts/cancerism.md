## When the Cure Is Worse Than the Disease

Imagine for a moment that in the past, innocent people were unfairly
given cancer. Imagine that it was bad and really unfair.

We know that if this were true, that it's a terrible thing to do.

Further suppose that the effects of these past cancers in some way
still affects society today. How best to deal with these lingering
effects?

What we _could do_, in order to 'balance out' the past injustice, is
give out more cancer today, but to new and _different_ innocents.

Would that make everything okay?

Does that make the past go away?
