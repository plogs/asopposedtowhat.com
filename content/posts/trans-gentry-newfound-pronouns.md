In these socially enlightened times it seems everyone and his brother
is coming out with a new identity. We're rife with transformations.
Who knew?

But why now? Have we always had men who are really women and women
who are really men, and just not noticed? Apparently so. And woe to
any bigot or non-[woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke)
individual who speaks out contrariwise.

Most people agree that adults have the right to transform themselves
in a way that makes their life better. And why not? More
power to them.

But sadly the
[postmodernist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism) thinking
that's used to justify this seemingly new world order is seen by many
to have gone too far. How far?

So far that reality as we used to know it in the pre-woke
days is no longer real. Yes that's right, no longer real. The idea
that there's an objective reality independent of human beings is
dismissed by postmodernists as a kind of naive realism.[^1] Naive as
in "simple minded." Naive as in "un-woke."

So what _is_ real, you might ask? Apparently nothing is really real
except what you feel is real. You know, your [lived
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lived_experience),[^2] man.
It's not about the facts, it's about you making sense of your
experiences. It's all socially constructed.

## It's all socially constructed

Really? I wondered. It's all socially constructed? So what happens
when I throw _my_ hat into the _it's all socially constructed_ ring.

Turns out I'm transgentry.

All my life I've felt like I was something different, maybe even
something special. When I look in the mirror, I see a worker, a
common man. But deep down inside I know there's more to me than
what's shown in the mirror. Deep down inside of me I see a king. Yes,
I'm a king born in a worker's body. I've felt this way all my life.

And indeed my 'lived experience' tells me it must be so. For
example, I truly enjoy it when people (of any class) wait on me and
bring me things. They might not appreciate the gaping disparity in
our respective social classes, but I do, and I wish them well.

## Gentry dysphoria

But I don't need to flaunt my greatness. I am what I am regardless of
what society thinks about me. So why reveal my
_[gentry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentry) dysphoria_ now, after
years of living like a peasant and making do?

The answer is simple: newfound pronouns.

In these socially malleable times one may now demand that a pronoun
serve at the pleasure of a given participant. In truth, failure to do
so may even be considered _oppressive_.[^3]

## Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that refers to a participant in a discourse. For
example, _she_ said this, or _he_ said that, or _they_ are coming
over for dinner.


Pronouns used to be self-evident. For example:

- he
- she
- him
- her
- himself
- herself
- they
- them

Now we have 'gender neutral' and 'gender inclusive' pronouns, such as:

- ve
- ze
- xem
- xyr
- perself
- verself
- humself

And there are many more ([What are the 78 Gender
pronouns?](https://bobcutmag.com/2021/09/07/what-are-the-78-gender-pronouns/)).
Language, as you know, evolves.[^4]

The problem is that demands to use certain words by the language
police (or by anyone else for that matter) are of course bad form and
extremely annoying.

Nevertheless, some people still cloyingly insist on the use of their
new and improved personal pronouns. When that happens, here are mine.


## Preferred gentry pronoun (PGP)


Whilst in my presence you may call me _YourHighness_ or _YourMajesty_.

For example, _HisHighness_ said this, or
_my liege_ said that, or _HisMajesty_ is coming over for dinner.

At all other times, _YourHighness_ will do.

We have spoken.

[^3]: Failing to respect someone else's identity preferences "is not
only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive," says The University of
Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Indeed, "When someone is referred to with the
wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated,
dismissed, alienated, or [gentry] dysphoric."

[^4]: Believe it or not, some even suggest that the use of _they_ as a
pronoun is now also unsuitable. Why? Because _they/them_ pronouns are
(wait for it...) gender-neutral, and "not all nonbinary people occupy
a space where they feel comfortable using 'they' pronouns".
