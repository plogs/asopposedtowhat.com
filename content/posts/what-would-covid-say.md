### COVID-19:

  Hello and welcome everyone (and I do mean everyone). Covid here,
  along with Polio...

### POLIO:

  Hi, folks. I don't get out much now, it's a treat for me just to be
  here.

### COVID-19:

  We're here on behalf of viruses everywhere to say thanks. Thanks to
  anti-masker-vaxxers for making this pandemic (and my submicroscopic
  existence) such a success.

### POLIO:

  Go... team!


### COVID-19:

  We recently reached our goal of 700,000 deaths...

### POLIO:

  [thumbs up]

### COVID-19:

  ...in the wealthiest country in the world. Take a knee, USA.


### POLIO:

  USA... USA...

### COVID-19:

  World War II cost 400,000 American lives. Covid 19? I'm nearly
  twice as expensive.


### POLIO:

  And still counting.


### COVID-19:

  That's right, Polio. Thanks to anti-masker-vaxxers.


### POLIO:

  In my day it was all about contaminated food and water.


### COVID-19:

  You had me at contaminated, Polio. Today, with lots of
  international travel, airborne is the key.


### POLIO:

  If only I could have flown.

### COVID-19:

  But it's not only thanks to air travel. Today we've got personal
  freedoms to carry us along. And aren't hospital beds meant to be
  used? I think you know we're on the right track when people hoard
  toilet paper.

### POLIO:

  Is that because they're full of shit?

### COVID-19:

  No, Polio. It's because nobody wants to be a lab rat. It's a
  personal freedom thing. Anti-masker-vaxxers refuse to be muzzled.


### POLIO:

  Our benefactors.

### COVID-19:

  Benefactors indeed. And so once again, _thanks_, to everyone who
  helped me spread. Feel free to blow me again. In a bar, in the car,
  at work, at the store; blow me when you snore. It's all good. I'm
  contagious!


### POLIO:

  Go Delta variant!

### COVID-19:

  And little Omicron, too.

  See you next year!
