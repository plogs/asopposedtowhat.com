A team of economic experts[^1] recently concluded that the computer
algorithms used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are _structurally
biased_ against Blacks, even though no racial information is
contained in a tax return.

How can anyone, let alone a computer algorithm, be biased if there's
nothing to be biased about?

One explanation is that the algorithms were primarily
designed to analyze easy-to-process tax returns. For example, returns
that do not include business income. So if you don't have business
income on your return, you're more likely to get audited. This would
be true regardless of race, obviously, but since a disproportionately
large number of Blacks do not include business income on their
returns, their returns are 'biased' and so more likely to be audited.

So bias -- in this sense -- doesn't have to be conscious (no human
auditors were involved) or intentional (no racial identifiers on tax
returns); but if we look at the numbers and review proportions,
then we see that bias happens.

What happens when we turn the bias-detecting Eye of Sauron away from
the IRS and shine it on other courts? Amazingly, we see a world rife
with bias.

For example, during basketball season it's obvious that Blacks are
disproportionately favored over Asians on the basketball court, even
though there is nothing to be gained by being biased. What does it mean
to be disproportionately favored?

It means that one group, for whatever reason (a complicated tax
return, for example), appears to get more than they 'deserve', and
this disproportionality is what is meant by structural bias.

What numbers do we see in basketball that reveal a
disproportionality? The United States, by population, is 6% Asian and
13% Black. In a structurally unbiased world we expect to see similar
proportions of the population represented throughout society (maybe
not exactly the same proportions, but certainly not wildly out of
whack proportions). And yet, incredibly, when we look at the
percentage of players by race participating in the National
Basketball Association, we find that 1% are Asian and 73% are Black.

That's a glaring disproportionality if ever there was one. Obviously
Blacks are being favored whether they realize it or not. But why is
that?

Does a legacy of slavery and racism somehow give Black players an
unearned advantage on the basketball court. Maybe, that's one
explanation, but truth be told, we don't actually know.

And even if we don't know, i.e., _regardless_ of the reason, glaring
disproportionalities like these strike many as unfair and socially
unjust. How do we fix the wrong and stamp out the injustice? How do
we paper over nasty reverberations from society's past and renovate
our world today?

One solution is to change the rules of basketball and give Asians five
points per basket instead of the usual two. Doing so would likely
encourage NBA team owners to employ more Asians.


Another solution is to allow Asians to wear elevator stilt-shoes[^2] during the
game to bring them closer to the hoop, to make it easier to score, to
even the playing field so-to-speak.
 One small equity stretch for Asian men,
one giant structural bias solution for mankind.

Would that make basketball games more interesting? Maybe. I'm sure
those elevator shoes would be a trip. But the point is, eliminating
structural bias wherever we find it is seen by many to be something
worth doing.

Whether it's tax returns at the IRS or employment
at the NBA, the bias-detecting Eye of Sauron sees all.
