  How to Think About Blaming the Victim (Jul 21, 2016)

Sometimes "blaming the victim" is okay. [when the victim becomes the problem]

We don't blame the victim for their plight, but for failing to
respond to their plight. The guilty party can only do so much to
restore the victim, to make things right again (if, indeed, one can
be made whole again).

Amy Wax talks about "The parable of the parapalegic."
Restitution from the oppressor can only do so much; eventually the
victim must struggle on his own to walk again. He must _want_ to get
better, and then he must _work_ to get better.

Gold Star medical care (i.e., all the money in the world) can only do
so much.




Society has mostly stopped running into pedestrians. The problem
still exists, but not in anyway like it did in the past.

Protect me from the 'injury' of forbidden opinions?

No. You need EXPOSURE to varying views. That how you learn to think and argue.
