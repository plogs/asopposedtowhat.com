## It's form, not formula.

Begin with what facinated you.

These are frameworks of principles, not rules. These [storygrid
ideas] are enabling constraints, to get you to have emergent things come.

They're not rigid rules. We're talking about the land of good
practices, not rigid practices.

There's no perfect work that anyone writes based on a formula.
Emergence is not a linear, cause-and-effect relationship. What makes
a story work are its emergent qualities. But you do need a structure
to begin with, something to hang your hat on. You also need a hat, and
someone to wear it.

## It's not enough to pick a path

It's not enough to pick a path, you must go down it. By doing so you
see things you couldn't possibly have seen if you didn't (that is,
before you started out).

## Mental models

Our mental models are not reality. But they are the maps that we use
to navigate the world. Pick a good one.
