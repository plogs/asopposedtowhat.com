# When You Assume

* When you assume you make an ass out of you and me.[^1]
  And yet, before it even makes sense to utter
  that statment, I assume you understand English; I assume that you
  can hear me, that you're listening, that you're not an asshat.


# Too many cooks

* Two many cooks spoil the broth &mdash; except, when two heads are better
  than one.

# Two heads are better

* Two heads are better than one &mdash; unless you're a cook making broth.


# Deep down inside

* Deep down inside we're all the same &mdash; Are you sure? said the man with
  stomach cancer.

# All your eggs in one basket

* Do not dedicate all your resources to one project.
  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.[^2] Or, as Mark
  Twain would say: "Put all your eggs in the one basket and &mdash; WATCH
  THAT BASKET."[^3]


[^1]: [ASS U ME]
