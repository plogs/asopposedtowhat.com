# When You Assume

* When you assume you make an ass out of you and me. [ASS U ME] &mdash;
  and yet, before it even makes sense to utter that statment, I
  assume you understand English; I assume that you can hear me, that
  you're listening, that you're not an asshat.


# Too many cooks

* Two many cooks spoil the broth &mdash; except, when two heads are better
  than one.

# Two heads are better

* Two heads are better than one &mdash; unless you're a cook making broth.


# Deep down inside

* Deep down inside we're all the same &mdash; Are you sure? said the man with
  stomach cancer.
