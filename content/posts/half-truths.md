# When You Assume

* When you assume you make an ass out of you and me.[^1]
  And yet, before it even makes sense to utter
  that statment, I assume you understand English; I assume that you
  can hear me, that you're listening, that you're not an asshat.

# Don't fix it if it ain't broke

* Don't fix it if it ain't broke &mdash; unless it's one of those
  problems that if you fix it now it may save you a lot of extra work
  later on. Because, as you know...

# A stitch in time saves nine.

* A stitch in time saves nine &mdash; but don't fix it if it ain't
  broke.


# Too many cooks

* Two many cooks spoil the broth &mdash; except, when two heads are better
  than one.

# Two heads are better

* Two heads are better than one &mdash; unless you're a cook making broth.


# Deep down inside

* Deep down inside we're all the same &mdash; Are you sure? said the man with
  stomach cancer.

# All your eggs in one basket

* Do not dedicate all your resources to one project.
  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.[^2] Or, as Mark
  Twain would say: "Put all your eggs in the one basket and &mdash; WATCH
  THAT BASKET."[^3]

# What does not kill me makes me stronger

* What does not kill me makes me stronger[^4] &mdash; unless you inhale too
  much coal dust and get black lung disease[^5], or smoke too many cigarettes
  and slowly waste away from cancer.
