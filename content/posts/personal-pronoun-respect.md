If I'm asked, for example, to respect gay marriage (even if it's
against my religious beliefs) or to be kind and pay for curb cuts for
the handicapped, those requests don't require me to change my
behaviour (except for paying taxes for something I might disagree
with). But asking me to 'respect' your personal pronouns[^1] does require
me to act differently.

It changes the way I speak; it changes the words that I use. And not
because I decided to speak differently (I think I speak just fine,
thank you very much), but because someone else's ideology tells me to
speak differently, regardless of what I may think about that
ideology. Indeed I'm compelled to speak differently if I wish to
avoid being ostracized.

'Respect' then -- in this case -- is merely a social nicety layered
on top of a shit sandwich. It really means that one is expected to
comply with another's view of the world, like it or not, no
discussion necessary.

That's not very nice.

Here then are some new words I don't normally use, and I say them
with all due respect: go fuck yourself.
