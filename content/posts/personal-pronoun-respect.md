If I'm asked, for example, to respect gay marriage (even if it's
against my religious beliefs) or to be kind and pay for sidewalk curb
cuts for the handicapped, those requests don't require me to change
my behaviour (except for paying taxes for something I might disagree
with). But asking me to 'respect' your personal pronouns does require
me to act differently.

It changes the way I speak; it changes the words that I use. And not
because I decided to speak differently (I think I speak just fine,
thank you very much), but because someone else's ideology tells me to
speak differently, regardless of what I might think about that
ideology. Indeed in some situations I'm compelled to speak
differently if I don't want to be ostracized.

'Respect' then -- in this case -- is really just a social nicety
layered on top of a shit sandwich. It really means I'm supposed to
agree with someone else's worldview, like it or not, no discussion
necessary. That's not very nice.

So you think I should respect your personal pronouns?

I think you should go fuck yourself.
