title: "On 'Respecting' Personal Pronouns"

If I'm asked, for example, to respect gay marriage (even if it's
against my religious beliefs) or to be kind and pay for sidewalk curb
cuts for the handicapped, those requests don't require me to change
my behaviour (except for paying taxes for something I might disagree
with). But asking me to 'respect' your personal pronouns does require
me to act differently.

It changes the way I speak; it changes the words that I use. And not
because I decided to speak differently (I think I speak just fine,
thank you very much), but because someone else's ideology tells me to
speak differently, regardless of what I might think about that
ideology. Indeed in some situations I'm compelled to speak
differently if I don't want to be ostracized.

'Respect' then -- in this case -- is really just a social nicety
lathered on top of a shit sandwich. It means I'm supposed to agree
with someone else's worldview, like it or not, no discussion
necessary, and then change what I say. "Thank you Sir, may I have
another?"[^1]

"Why are you making such a big of a deal out of this? Times change.
Language changes. It's like you're some kind of linguistic Luddite.
Get with the times, man. It's really not that hard to use a person's
personal pronouns. You'll get used to it. Why don't you just be
_nice?_"

[long pause]

Why don't you go fuck yourself?
