Being asked, for example, to respect gay marriage (even if it's
against my religious beliefs) or to be kind and pay for curb cuts for
the handicapped, doesn't require me to change my behaviour (except
for paying taxes for something I might disagree with). But
'respecting' someone else's personal pronouns does require me to act
differently.

It changes the way I speak; it changes the words that I use. And not
because I decided to speak differently (I think I speak just fine
already, thank you very much), but because someone else's ideology
tells me to speak differently, regardless of what I may think about
that ideology. Indeed I'm compelled to speak differently if I wish to
avoid being ostracized,

Here are some different words that I don't normally use, and I say
this with all due respect: go fuck yourself.
