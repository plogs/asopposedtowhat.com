### COVID-19:

  Hello and welcome everyone (and I do mean everyone). Covid here,
  along with Polio...

### POLIO:

  [looking old and tired]

  Hi, folks. I don't get out much now, it's a treat for me just to be
  here.

### COVID-19:

  We're here on behalf of viruses everywhere to say thanks. Thanks to
  all you anti-masker-vaxxers for making this pandemic (and my
  submicroscopic existence) such a success.

### POLIO:

  [barely able to lift up his arm]

  Go... team!


### COVID-19:

  We recently reached our goal of 700,000 deaths...

### POLIO:

  [thumbs up]

### COVID-19:

  ...in the wealthiest country in the world. Take a knee, USA.


### POLIO:

  [Polio bobs his head and mouths: USA... USA... USA...]

### COVID-19:

  Remember Saving Private Ryan? World War II? We 'lost' 400,000
  American lives in that one. Covid 19? I've killed almost twice as
  many.


### POLIO:

  And still counting.


### COVID-19:

  That's right, Polio. Thanks to anti-masker-vaxxers.


### POLIO:

  In my day it was all about contaminated food and water.


### COVID-19:

  You had me at contaminated, Polio. But today with international
  travel and such, being airborne is the key.


### POLIO:

 [with sullen doggy droopy face]

  I wish I could fly.

### COVID-19:

  Sure but it's not all about air travel. Today we've got personal
  freedoms to deal with. Forget about your neighbor's grandma, your
  overweight and immunocompromised friends. Hospital beds are meant
  to be used. When people hoard toilet paper, then we know we're on
  the right track.

### POLIO:

  Is that because they're full of shit?

### COVID-19:

  No, Polio. It's because nobody wants to be a lab rat. It's a
  personal freedom thing. We have anti-masker-vaxxers to thank. The
  people who won't be muzzled.


### POLIO:

  Right, our benefactors.

### COVID-19:

  Yes, our benefactors. And so once again, thanks anti-masker-vaxxer
  guys and gals. Thanks for spreading me around. Feel free to blow me
  any time. In a bar, in the car, at work, at the store; blow me when
  you snore. It's all good. I'm contagious!

  With enough hard work we'll reach a million deaths.


### POLIO:

  Thanks again, anti-masker-vaxxers. Go Delta variant!

### COVID-19:

  And little Omicron, too. That's all for now. See you next year!
