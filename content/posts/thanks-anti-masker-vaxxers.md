COVID19:

  Hello and welcome everyone (and I do mean everyone). I'm Covid,
  here with Polio...

POLIO:

  Hi, folks [always old and tired]

COVID19:

  We'd like to take just a moment of your time to say thanks. Thanks
  to all the anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers for making COVID-19 such a
  success.

POLIO:

  Go team [barely able to lift up his arm]

COVID19:

  We recently reached our goal of 700,000 deaths...

POLIO:

  [thumbs up]

COVID19:

  ...in the wealthiest country in the world. Take a knee USA

[Polio bobs his head to Covid voice over of: USA... USA... USA]

COVID19:

  Remember Saving Private Ryan? World War II? We 'lost' [air quotes]
  400,000 American lives in that one. Covid 19? [smuggly] I've kill
  almost twice as many.


POLIO:

  And still counting.


COVID19:

  That's right, Polio; thanks to anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers.


POLIO:

  I was spread through contaminated food and water.


COVID19:

  You had me at contaminated, Polio; but as you know, I fly through
  the air.


POLIO:

  I wish I could have done that. [sullen doggy droopy face]

COVID19:

  Sorry, but those days are long gone. Today we have personal
  freedoms. Forget about [wave hand, dismissive] your neighbor's
  grandma. Hospital beds are meant to be used. We've even got people
  hoarding toilet paper again.

POLIO:

  [very innocently] Is that because they're full of shit?

COVID19:

  No, Polio. It's because nobody wants to be a lab rat. It's a
  personal freedom issue. But it's not all about us, right Polio?


POLIO:

  [quick head shake no, not all about us]

COVID19:

  It's about the anti-maskers. People who won't be muzzled know that
  your mouth DOES have RIGHTS.

  And so feel free to blow me, whenever you want. In a bar, in the
  car, at work, at the store, blow me when you snore. I'm contagious!
  [say 'contagious' like Eddie Murphy saying 'waffles']

  I know it's a hard job, but some patriots got to do it if this
  virus [pointing to self] going to reach a million deaths.

  And you anti-vaxxers? [big smile] You're keeping us alive.

POLIO:

  Go Delta variant!


COVID19:

  That's all for now. [wave bye] Til next year!
