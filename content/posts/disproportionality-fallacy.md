## Life isn't fair

We all know that life isn't fair, and yet, curiously, that doesn't
stop us from grabbing the first simplistic solution we can find and
then using it to beat even the most complex of problems about the
head and shoulders.
Case in point, race relations in the United States.

There's clearly a problem, we are told, as anyone can plainly see
when they look at the statistics, that minorities are treated unfairly
in this country. How so? Well, blacks make up 12% of the general population,
but they account for 38% of the prison population. [^1]

That's an obvious disproportionally. That looks like a racial
disparity. Therefore blacks are being unfairly treated. Right?
Disproportionality equals disparity. Disparity equals unfair. Unfair
means problem. Problems can and should be solved.

Now that we see the problem, what can we do about it?
How do we fix those numbers? Don't you _care_ about what's going
on in the world?

But wait.

It's true that the racial makeup of the prison population is not in
alignment with the general population. And if the metric by which we
judge is skin color, then the numbers are out-of-whack. But is this
whackiness necessarily unfair? Can disproportionality numbers in and
of themselves tell us when the problem is solved, or even if there
_is_ a problem to be solved?

I don't think so. In this case it seems unlikely that race relations
in the United States can adequately be understood or addressed by a
one-dimensional skin color metric.


More likely, this is an instance of the disproportionality fallacy.

## The disproportionality fallacy

The disproportionality fallacy is simply the mistake we sometimes
make when we assume something _should_ be proportional when there is
actually no good reason to assume that it should.




The National Basketball Association (NBA) apparently strongly favors
black and brown skinned players over white and yellow players.



Jews comprise only 0.2% of the world's population, and yet they
represent 22% of all Nobel prize recipients. Which is to say, the
Jewish share of winners is 110 times their proportion of the world's
population.[^2]
