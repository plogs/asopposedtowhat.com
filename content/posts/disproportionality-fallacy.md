## Life isn't fair

We all know life isn't fair, which is maybe why we so badly want to
jump to simple solutions when we see things so obviously seemingly
wrong. Case in point, race relations in the United States.

Clearly there's a problem -- Isn't there? -- with the treatment of
minorities in this country. How so? Well, black Americans, for
example, make up 12% of the general population and yet they account
for 38% of the prison population. [^1]

That's an obvious disproportionally. It looks like a racial
disparity. So apparently blacks are being unfairly treated.
Disproportionality equals disparity. Disparity equals unfair. Unfair
means problem. Problems can and should be solved.

Now that we see the problem, what can we do about it?
How do we fix those numbers? Don't you _care_ about what's going
on in the world?

But wait.

It's true that the racial makeup of the prison population does not
align with the racial makeup of the general population; and if skin
color is the metric by which we are to judge, then the numbers are
out-of-whack. But is this whackiness necessarily unfair? Is focusing
on fixing disproportinate numbers the way to solve the problem? Even
more bluntly, is this type of _number disproportionately_ necessarily
an indicator that there _is_ a problem to be solved?

No.

Especially in this case.

Why? Because it seems unlikely that race relations in the US can be
adequately understood or addressed by anything as simplistic as a
one-dimensional skin color metric.


To be clear, this is not to say there is or are no problems made
manifest by treating different groups unfairly; but only that obvious
disproportionalities are not necessarily signs of a problem. This
brings us to the disproportionality fallacy.


## The disproportionality fallacy

The disproportionality fallacy is simply the mistake we sometimes
make when we see a disproportionality and then assume there is a
problem to be solved. That is, we observe that the ratio of
X-to-something doesn't match the ratio of Y-to-something and then
conclude unfairness is afoot.

The example above is a case in point. Why is it that the percentage
of blacks in the population doesn't match the percentage of
blacks in prisons?

Well, there are probably lots of reasons, but ratio of prison to
general popluation doesn't really tell us anything. But they should
be equal, shouldn't they?


Again, not necessarily. And here's why.

If we assume disproportionality means unfair, then we have to
...



The National Basketball Association (NBA) apparently strongly favors
black and brown skinned players over white and yellow players.



Jews comprise only 0.2% of the world's population, and yet they
represent 22% of all Nobel prize recipients. Which is to say, Jewish
laureates outrank the world's population by 110 times in terms of
proportionality.[^2]

Is this discrimination? Is this a sign of a problem to be solved?



What can explain these differences?

    culture, education, religion, genetics, world history, ideology,
    family background, upbringing, socialization, etc.

But is misdiagnosing a problem really such a problem?

Yes, and here's why.


## When the cure is worse than the disease

For a long time stomach ulcers were thought to be caused by spicy
foods, stress, and even xxxx. But in the 1980s we discovered the true
cause: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).
