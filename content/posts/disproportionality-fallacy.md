## Life isn't fair

We all know life isn't fair, which is maybe why it's so easy for us
to continue using bad arguments to simplify situations into problems
easily solved if only everyone else could see as clearly as we. Case
in point, race relations in the United States.

Black Americans make up 13% of the general population, and yet they
account for 38% of the prison population.[^1]

Assuming that life should be proportional by race, that's an obvious
disproportionality. Furthermore, we know that Blacks used to be
slaves in this country (i.e., discriminated against), and so that
knowledge, coupled with this modern day disproportionality, can only
mean that Blacks are _still_ being discriminated against.

Right?

Isn't that the simplest, most straightforward explanation?

It's definitely simple and straightforward, but is it the most
likely explanation? Let's think about that.

In order to pick the most likely explanation, you must first be aware
of other possible explanations. Also it's possible that things are
not as simple as they seem; maybe several contributing factors come
into play.

What other factors, if any, might explain disproportionalities
between groups that we think should be treated proportionally?

The short answer is _culture_.

"Culture can and does alter our brains, hormones, and anatomy, along
with our perceptions, motivations, personalities, emotions, and many
other aspects of our minds." [^2]

But isn't blaming 'culture', in this context, just another excuse for
racism? Well of course it _could_ be, but is it? (If you're intent on
seeing the world through racist lenses, then you will always see what
you're looking for.)

## Culture

The short answer is culture. The long answer is that there are many
aspects to a person's life that affect what they do, how they live,
and how others respond. Here are some examples from, "_The
Weirdest people in the world_," by Joseph Henrich. [^3]


 * Religious convictions can powerfully shape decision-making,
   psychology, and society.


 * Beliefs, practices, technologies, and social norms can shape our
   brains, biology, and psychology, including our motivations, mental
   abilities, and decision-making biases.

 * Psychological changes induced by culture can shape all manner of
   subsequent events by influencing what people pay attention to, how
   they make decisions, which institutions they prefer, and how much
   they innovate.


One's culture then, is made up of many things: education, religion,
genetics, world history, ideology, family background, upbringing,
socialization, and so on. In short, it's complicated.

But why not just take the easy approach and always assume that
disproportionalities _must_ point to problems to be solved?

Because in most other contexts, that would be silly.

For example, the U.S. population is 6% Asian and 13% Black. And yet
when we look at the percentage of players-by-race participating in
the National Basketball Association (NBA), we find 1% Asian and 73%
Black. That's a whopping disproportionality. What's going on?
Asian discrimination? Structural racism?

Jews make up _less than one percent_ of the world's population, and
yet they account for 22% of all Nobel prize recipients. Which is to
say, Jewish laureates outrank the world's population in terms of
proportionality by 110 times.[^4] Is that disproportionality
indicative of some weird ethno-religious discrimination against
non-Jews?

At nearly every age, divorce rates are higher for Black than for
White women, and they are generally lowest among Asian and
foreign-born Hispanic women.[^5] Are Black and White women
discriminated against, in favor of Asian and foreign-born Hispanic
women, when it comes to picking long-term mates?

AIAN people (American Indian or Alaska Native) showed the highest
percentage of unrestrained passenger vehicle occupants killed (65%)
followed by Black or African American people (61%).[^6] Obviously a
disproportional percentage of the population. What causes people to
not wear seatbelts. Discrimination?

Whites make up 60% of the population but only 50% of the traffic
accidents? [^7] Are Whites just not trying hard enough, or is there
some kind of problem?

Not necessarily. And that's the thing. It's easy for us to use bad
arguments to simplify problems, even when the world is complicated.
And so we fall victim to the disproportionality fallacy.

It may in fact be true that Blacks are still systemically
discriminated against in this country, but don't use
disproportionality as your proof, because if you do, then we'll end
up with goofy 'solutions' like affirmative action for
White and Asian NBA players -- you know, to make things more equal,
to _solve_ the disproportionality problem.

No.

## Mind your portions

Try harder to understand what's really going on, _if anything_. And
beware the disproportionality fallacy.
