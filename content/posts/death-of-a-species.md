What would happen if you woke up tomorrow and discovered that the
only males left in the world were cisgender[^1] men, and the only
females left in the world were transgender[^2] women? What would
happen to the human species?

What would happen is that our species would eventually die out. It
would be the end of civilization.

Our species would eventually die out because humans are animals that
propagate via sexual reproduction, and transgender women, regardless
of how they identify or appear to the world, are still, biologically
speaking, males.

Human sexual reproduction requires the fusion of two types of
gametes. Male gametes (sperm), and female gametes (eggs).[^3]

In our well-intentioned attempts to treat everyone equally, this
distinction is often lost.
